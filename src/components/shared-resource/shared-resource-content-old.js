                Not totally sure how to formulate this but I am wondering about the use of time within the video, as well as how it circulates in the narrative as shifting around, but also to do with the rhythm of the body (being out time = pissing at night), and how going from some of the references, if there is a relation to the notions of ‘crip time\'

Bente Castro Campos (11:12)
Also the experience of inconsistency of women after giving birth

Mathew Parkin (11:13)
also with holding piss in, just thinking urine has an economic value

Ari Nielsson (11:16)
Lacking the video as a frame of reference here but from the discussion I\'m wondering about a linked space between holding urine in out of necessity, containing urine as a means of concentration (freezing, evaporating), concentrations and magical uses, and how these differing aspects might meet in the body

Mary Maggic (she/they) (11:18)
I recommend this book for reading the types of clinical and research trials for commodifying estrogen

Also Elizabeth Freeman\'s Time Binds. https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/1478/Time-BindsQueer-Temporalities-Queer-Histories - goes quite deep into queer resistance of capitalist time in film.
Leaky bodies and boundaries Magrit Shildrick

Mary Maggic (she/they) (11:57)
hi sophie i think the images show an interesting correlation between the fragile body and the planetary body. i'm just wondering why you decided to have static non-moving images and text versus moving footage and vocalizing the text?
I would also check out the work of Jessika Khazrik who has also been researching the explosion in beirut and methods of mutual aid beyond state intervention

You can see some of the projects that Collective Text has worked on here;
https://www.instagram.com/collectivetext/?hl=en

Mary Maggic (she/they) (12:04)
ok i see then perhaps you would want to lean more into that sense of immobility, because you as an outside observer witnessing a disaster, really mirrors the state of paralysis of not just the destroyed land but also the onlookers, observing

Mary Maggic (she/they) (12:04)
on a personal level also parallels your own immobility

Ari Nielsson (12:13)
I found this very beautiful. In some ways the editing (as well as aspects of the content) reminded me of Marguerite Duras\' text ‘Writing\', where she recounts telling a visitor a story about the death of a fly on the wall of her house. It\'s a small event that through repetition and a somehow tender attention takes on the character of a fully-realised disaster, of tragedy. Touching (slightly) on what Mary mentioned about the relation between the fragile body and the planetary body, is this kind of microcosmic or metonymic perspective a conscious way of dealing with your distance (physical and other) from the events you're dealing with?
Notes:
Think the process of captioning and audio description is super interesting and generative - especially when translating one sensory register into another - feels really pertinent to your work - think you\'d really enjoy working through these processes
On experimentation with captions and access tools - also the work of Jordan Lord 
Also https://www.quiplash.co.uk/
I loved the attentiveness to texture – flimsy membranes and contested thresholds, patina, grain, pixels, skins the breaking down of materials into their constituent parts 
Trinh T. Minh-ha working alongside 
Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha discusses working from bed in Care Work: Dreaming Disability Justice which I found helpful, but you might already know it 
Abjection - terminology taken from 80\'s post structuralist feminism
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_Horror
Maybe there ae some interetsing contemp/crip/queer reclaimations of this term?
Thinking of Linda Stupart\'s working with abjection might also be helpful (https://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/linda-stupart-interview)
Kirsty Hendry (12:17)
Just picking up on Bryony's comment on scale - have you seen the work on a screen larger than a laptop? I feel the experiencing it on the big flat screen here would be quite a different experience vs viewing on a laptop - feels like this attentiveness to scale is amplified in this sense - these close up zooms becoming more immersive/more like environments

Mary Maggic (she/they) (12:19)
yes I agree with lucy, what is the narrative intention with switching from static images to moving image? moving from isolation and immobility to becoming animated again?

Sophie Cundale (12:22)
In relation this I wondered about one of the main or what felt like one of the more physical actions of the movie = where the scalpel is like playing with a skin like form/ organ - and what this action is showing?

Mary Maggic (she/they) (12:25)
the scalpel really reminded me of digging into the flesh of the earth, maybe Samir Bhowmik's research on terra-performing and extractivism might be interesting for you https://www.uniarts.fi/en/projects/black-ecologies-performing-art-in-the-extraction-zone/

Also in terms of translation the effect of aerial bombed landscapes into visual images - it reminded me of a work by Lawrence Abu Hamdan - called Air Conditioning (2022) where he visualises the noise of the Israeli occupation of Lebanese airspace in bruised cloud-like formation which you view as an installation. 

The close ups of the epidermis were really mesmerising and appeared like landscapes, which relates to the macro political level of some of the voiceover. Picking up on Brontes last point - one of the over-riding questions seems to be how you imagine the next phase of the work in relation to the interplay between voiceover and the images of your body? 


Kirsty Hendry (12:28)
would love to read the full text Sophie - would be nice to sit with it and spend more time with it

Ari Nielsson (12:28)
There\'s something here, it also seems to me, about the relationship between the extreme close-up and the sense of an environment it gives, but that these are at the same time identifiably or intuitively 'small' objects - Susan Stewart\'s book on the miniature and the gigantic, On Longing, may be an interesting text for you and this continuing discussion of scale

Susan Stewart ‘On Longing: Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection\'  (Duke, 1993)
In terms of, approaching the world from the interior, particularly the domestic interior, and the durational aspect of the shots and their repeating rhythm, both the editing and the content made me think of Marguerite Duras\' text ‘Writing\'. I have a pdf of this I could share - perhaps someone could indicate where, if anywhere, this could be done?

“Prayer to Fosforos”

Me who is dirt, a dust, of stars
Me who is carbon, primeval

I rise those words to you,
Who was born in almighty light

Who has come down to Earth's abyss
To be present on Earth as in heavens

You so luminous, buried - to be resurrect
In all what lives on Earth

You - source of life,
You who are giving us our daily bread

I direct my thoughts to you
In times of war, fuel gas scarcity

You who was for so long excavated,
manufactured and sold

Formerly – in opulence, in blooming waters
Now – too expensive to get You

Yet… you are always most precious
For those most humble, forgotten

Those living on barren land
They need You the most

Each day I'm getting rid of you
Like you were worthless

I didn\'t know
how important you were to me

But you are always for me
I get you in my blood

So now, I\'m offering You
By pissing on this roots

Speeding up Your embodiment
by millions of years

Bless You Fosforos!

Prayer to Fosforos
Outdoor Peeing as a Offering

Ari Nielsson (13:04)
Phosphorous weapons, as well

Andra Nadirshah (13:06)
There's a great book called Alchemy of Air about the birth of the Haber-Bosch process (which involved nitrogen more so than P). This process was developed in Germany during the 30s/40s in order to artificially produce nitrogen-rich fertilizer (and now accounts for feeding 2/3rds of the human population of the world, roughly), but also was instrumental in the production of weapons during wwii

https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/73464/the-alchemy-of-air-by-thomas-hager-author-of-the-demon-under-the-microscope/
William Gibbs (18th C) potentially a relevant case history in terms of colonial extractive fertiliser production, capitalism, feeding the munitions trade. A fortune made in guano in Bolivia and Peru, shipped back to europe, at great harm to the local populations and the Chinese labour brought in to mine it
You've mentioned community outreach and the potential of social media, is there a way of reframing the fertiliser potential that also, or more explicitly, reacts to these histories of industrial and colonial exploitation (and energy weaponisation) as a component of activating this potential in these individual - as Gabriel put it, ‘small acts of peeing\'?

Hi andra, i wonder how you position this project along the lines of speculative fiction and/or culture hacking? as i understand, mone water is extracting toxicities from the environment and selling it back to the people in the language and discourse of trendy consumerist culture

i also think glamorizing the effects of endocrine disruption walks a very thin line and could potentially alienate us even more from the pollution issue. i wonder how you would respond to communities who live directly in contaminated conditions and unclean water (or i would be prepared to answer a question like that)

Mary Maggic (she/they) (16:34)
yes then i would focus on that gwyneth paltrow strata of society as your primary audience. i see this project operating along the lines of banksy and selling this obey brand to the rich and oblivious

Simon Werrett (16:40)
presumably if you said it contains hormones but they are inactive and are just there to indicate to people that they are there, then there wouldn't be a legal problem.
Andy Pickering has a great book The Mangle of Practice that might be of interest because he starts from the basis that nature is not yet made - so the human and natural (animal) are constantly unfolding together in new unpredictable ways - there's no “nature” out there to return to or see as a “pristine" original.

Mary Maggic (she/they) (16:40)
the project doesnt have to be about body autonomy and disseminating knowledge, it might be more effective as a consumerist hacking object of desire, perhaps even conceal the irony and biopolitics to make it more sellable

Thermodynamics and energy 
Simon Werrett (17:25)
“Each portion of matter may be conceived as a garden full of plants, and as a pond full of fish. But each branch of a plant, each limb of an animal, each drop of its humours, is also such a garden or such a pond” Leibniz - Monadology
Regarding entropy - simon\'s comment: experimental short story on this - Heat Death of the Universe, Pamela Zoline.
Ari Nielsson (17:27)
There\'s a gaelic womens\' working song called a ‘waulking song\', specific to the process of fulling woven tweed fabric with their own urine to make the wool tighter and more waterproof
might be able to find the waulking song on the Scottish sound archive too - https://scotlands-sounds.nls.uk/ 

Ari Nielsson (17:28)
Possibly interesting in terms of labour, measuring time, materials and archive (minimal, afaik, but I think there are snippets from pathé, probably more specific sources)

And Timothy Mitchell\'s Carbon Democracy is great at connecting fossil energy & labor !


Philipp (17:29)
I like the graphic quality of the shots, they are calm and dont overshadow the text. I read this as a visual Essay, which contains complex sentences with a lot of meaning. Maybe it could be useful to treat the text more as a graphic / typographic element rather than a subtitle. On one side, to make it more legible visually, but also, to display more text in one shot. As i think that the text could be split rather into text passages than singular sentences, as it is now. So you could show more text and visually balance it with the Images + making the text more bold and thus more legible.

Or maybe even show the text in a completely different channel / screen. Or on a completely different medium.

Mary Maggic (she/they) (17:31)
hi xiyao, what do you think is the connection between your field recordings and the metaphysical text from leibniz as it relates to the human construct of “energy”? i'm asking this very broad question because it isn't immediately obvious from the video, especially because it isnt finished yet

Mary Maggic (she/they) (17:32)
and im curious how you plan to conclude the video, it might be helpful to see the whole text. im assuming the text came first and the audiovisuals got layered on top

Lucy Beech (17:37)
sunflowers and natural magic - Sunflower clock as a model of the cosmos / thinking about sun as a non-thermodynamic approach to energy - Thermodynamic picture of the world and relationships to waste.

Lucy Beech (17:37)
Entropy - don\'t waste energy because it is finite 

Ari Nielsson (17:37)
I'm curious about the form of energy that's discussed in the video. In some ways it seems quite industrial, especially in terms of how industrial or mechanical conceptions of energy are discussed feeding back into metaphors of the human body, but I'm wondering whether it's worth considering other or older forms of energy, for example animism which is quite metaphysical, or older elemental ideas - after the discussions of the gut I'm reminded of pythagoras\' mystery cult where the body was imagined to contain a finite amount of motive gases, or air, farting therefore shortened life and vitality

Ari Nielsson (17:39)
So, more concisely: Is your interest primarily focused on energy as a metaphor between machine and body, or, are you also looking towards a more expansive history of which this is one part?

Simon Werrett (17:45)
great book on energy - Anson Rabinbach, The Human Motor: Energy, Fatigue, and the Origins of Modernity (New York: Basic Books, 1990) (https://www.are.na/block/1392417 free pdf)

Not sure if this is a bit far fetched but previously you spoke about these action figures, that can be collectable and kitsch, so I was thinking how normally they are frozen/still in this position of power/attack, and then I thought of the position of standing still, open legs, dick in the hand, peeing in a urinol and how that can rhyme with that frozen moment of attack of the figures?

The animation and the humorous aspects even regarding serious ecological questions reminded me of Clara Hastrup\'s work ( clarahastrup.com ) although I can\'t point to a specific work right now to connect this to. But perhaps an interesting reference in terms of deploying some of these tensions.

Mathew Parkin (14:55)
Linking to Lucys point - I wonder about the economic value of insects vs cows. My ex came from a dairy farm and I was shocked when explained how much a cow was worth financially vs a fly.

Jenna Sutela (14:56)
Snowpiercer by Bong Joon-Ho

Slightly irrelevant maybe but I\'m thinking of my biggest memory of the cow in the news or in media, and the one that looms in my memory more then any other is the foot and mouth epidemic in the UK and the footage of that which is relevant in some way in the process of making waste perhaps 

Bente: Just for reference, this is the article "On dictators and clowns" that I mentioned in my talk: https://rai.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-8322.12729

Ari Nielsson (15:35)
There's an interesting reference/discussion on medieval french bathouses in Vigarello's ‘Concepts of Cleanliness\' that relates hygiene and sexuality (but with radically different conceptions, particularly on hygiene, water, penetrability) and the moral governance of the urban space

Wilma Stone (15:45)

Some ideas around formal investigations and the ‘unreliable witness\' (how this is proved/disproved) or ‘contamination\' of evidence to the point that it can\'t be ‘used\' (in court etc)

Ari Nielsson (16:18)
An additional observation: I really enjoyed the poppers as an element of an increasingly ‘unreliable' or deformalised narrative voice, which James also mentioned in relation to Dustan\'s writing: is this something you've primarily conceived in the context of this presentation, or is it a device you're considering also for other kinds of storytelling and video?

https://www.sunandsea.lt/en maybe interesting if you\'re not already aware - although I'm not suggesting you should turn this into an opera

Bryony Gillard she/her (16:50)
Rory Pilgrim\'s use of music and pop - in their video works - might be an interesting reference for you - they are also working in the filed of eco-poetics. I was also thinking about the pop song as a really interesting vehicle for ideas which has such wide potential for dissemination - https://www.rorypilgrim.com

McKenzie Wark - Molecular Red (2015)

Jenna Sutela (16:54)
Couldn\'t help but think of this cute musical teaching: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-kYjjphxJY

Mathew Parkin (17:03)
thinking slightly about silent films use of text cards for context info and live musical accompaniment

Andra Nadirshah (17:09)
It feels like a type of infiltration politics to package the contents being discussed in specifically this genre of music and this style of footage/editing. I think that also ties in nicely with the disruption of nitro. cycle you discuss. This style of indie music, for me at least as well, does represent this era of pop in which there was a growing cognitive dissonance between the acoustic indie style of the predominant music of the 2000s and the growing inescapability of a sense of apocalypse and this type of late-capitalist exhaustion.

Kirsty Hendry (17:15)
Thinking of Charlotte Prodger's film Bridgit which was all shot on their iphone

Andra Nadirshah (17:15)
seconded on that, kirsty

Working With Waste : Meeting 2
Day 3: 22.09.2022
Event: Artist talk and Screening 


Jenna Sutela

Lucy Beech (10:58)
questions in the chat please - we are having problems with peoples questions in the room being heard so I will feed them into the chat.

Observation from jim: 
the voice is so important
It\'s like you are leading with the voice
the voice as access to the gut
can you speak about the voice and the mouth

Jim R (11:00)
the voice and mouth, could you speak a bit about it

Lucy Beech (11:02)
I was thinking about colostrum as the "first milk,” helps a baby pass it\'s first stool
interested in the relationship between shit and milk but also waste and use 

Lucy Beech (11:03)
Kirsty would like to ask about the role of voice and  the idea of coherence and being understood. She was thinning about how the gut communicates with us and then for example if you are told that your taking out your ass
your speaking nonsense
interested in interplay in presenting the gut having a language
but we still as viewers still not having full access to what is being said

ari (11:08)
Im interested in the microscopic and macroscopic as both kinda the same size, in terms of their extreme distance or legibility from the human body. In these cosmological swings, what is the position of the person?

Sophie Fefe (11:09)
The mood and feel of the work is very strong - and I wondered how you arrive or negotiate the mood and tone of the piece with your protagonists? Could the videos even be described as a kind of shared consciousness between you?

Sophie Hoyle (They/Them) (11:09)
https://marijabozinovskajones.com/projects  also works with AI, and scales between the bodily and planetary

Lucy Beech (11:10)
Reference was made to Hélène Smith

Andra Nadirshah (11:11)
Politics of breast milk sharing -https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/one-womans-baby-another-womans-breast-milk/391098/ . There is some reddit forum that I haven't been able to find just now about specifically a subculture of men interested in a sort of "macho naturalism” throwing out the breast milk their respective wives acquired from other women because of feeling it violates a sort of familial territoriality. They don't want their wife using the breast milk of others feeling it doesn't respect their "choice" in the mother e.g. not only the genetics of the child, but the nutritional content they receive in early life must also derive from their chosen partner exclusively. Perhaps you already know about this, but thought it was an interesting politicization and defining of the "natural” culture vs. "synthetic" culture of the development of a baby/person.

I think I remember some aspect of the nestlé problematic having to do with babies used to the formula also rejecting body-milk afterwards? This might be false consciousness / feedback loop with breast milk - where mothers catch antibodies from baby. There are things that cannot be synthetically replicated do you see the way you work with these organisms as giving them an agency or is it still you using them as co-creator? or even objects

Lucy Beech (11:28)
Practical question about the first film from Bronte :
The sci-fi aspect of your work and filming in that lab - was it a real lab and were they actors or scientists - and what are the tensions of imposing fiction on scientists work. In other words how do you negotiate the division between empirical science and fiction.

Lucy Beech (11:33)
Could you talk a bit more about waste as unwanted materials? ….I was thinking about single use plastics and the lab when watching and the ways in which working with waste often produces more waste / energy consumption - take for example Woj\'s project around phosphorus processing and energy use. Is this something you thought much about in the lab?

Lucy Beech (11:33)
A question from Sophie Cundale: Science fiction - she mentioned the ways that D. Harraway talks about string theory - as interconnectedness
Is there any relation of this work to string figures / uses of pattern + background in computation art how doe this relate to the way Jenna is working now

Sophie has the the Donna Haraway quote to hand, she uses SF to describe ‘a sign for science fiction, speculative feminism, science fantasy, speculative fabulation, science fact, and also string figures\'

Lucy Beech (11:36)
Someone has a question here about the use of emotion - it seems a lot is being communicated but not through narrative or linear narrative - is emotion something you try and avoid? or is it something unavoidable?

For sophoie the experience of watching - resonates in the body somewhere

ari (11:41)
Are you familiar with Nathalie du Pasquier? There\'s a microbial/viral aspect to her textiles and more recent sculptures that I was reminded of here

https://www.onyekaigwe.com/a-so-called-archive

Lucy Beech (12:31)
I was thinking about the use of loop on one hand and the trajectory of the reverb being quite different and I was thinking also about the loop in relation to intergenerational trauma and the experiences of lost genealogies

Sophie Hoyle (12:31)
https://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/post-orientalist-aesthetics%E2%80%A8experimental-film-and-video-in-lebanon/
https://mfdisplaced.org/assembly-chronicles-of-displacement/

Kirsty Hendry (12:33)
maybe not so directed to the film but maybe useful in terms of wider research/approaches to auto-ethnography; https://fairglasgow.wordpress.com/about-2/

Jim R (12:36)
https://www.amazon.com/Dub-Soundscapes-Shattered-Ja
Kinda linked to the question above, but could you maybe talk a bit about traveller archives and history versus the present? Is the present being archived, and how do you think about your relationship to that if so, compared to this ‘historical\' material

David Leal (12:40)
In the "first part" of the video there's a tunnel-like type of images showing, can you tell us more about these first images in the video? very hypnotic

Sophie Hoyle (12:43)
following on from Dub, tape loops, polyvocality and film soundscapes Trevor Mathison\'s work is great, esp. with Handsworth Songs by Black Audio Film Collective

Mathew Parkin (12:44)
Is there something about the pauses, slips, etc as ways for these voices that have been put in the archive and reused to have some agency through refusal. Also something about through digitisation, transfer, editing and data degradation as being somehow an interesting process that also allows refusal.

Mathew Parkin (12:46)
also you may have read it but ‘Irish Travellers : racism and the politics of culture' was really helpful for me in terms of exploring that heritage as well as addressing the issues of those communities being skeptical about inveterntion from the state or researcher

And related to what Brontë is saying, the role of ‘critical fabulation\'  - which came up yesterday in Matthew\'s session

Lucy Beech (13:01)
interested in the apect of your research relates to working with waste - scavenging, gleaning and mending as survival strategies.

Kirsty Hendry (13:01)
https://earlycinema.gla.ac.uk/topic/fairgrounds/


It\'s more a reference but there is a collaborative work Lucy Clout made in 2016 with their mother called “The Fact That I Taught You to Speak − What\'s That?\' which uses a lot of pauses and stutters in conversation and is somewhat to do with generational learning. I screened it at LUX Scotland AMIF in 2018, I\'m not really sure if it\'s circulated much outside that but I can ask Lucy if I can share it with you. 

Fran Lock - Dogtooth 2017 Dogtooth is a book about ghosts. Not in the undead sense, but more as in the spectres and echoes of absent friends

Gypsy Feminism: Intersectional Politics, Alliances, Gender and Queer Activism (2017) might also be useful 

https://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/post-orientalist-aesthetics%E2%80%A8experimental-film-and-video-in-lebanon/
https://mfdisplaced.org/assembly-chronicles-of-displacement/

you might also be interested in the work/research of Mitch Miller (also involved in FAIR) in terms of working with traveller and showperson cultural heritage and oral histories
http://www.dialectograms.com/portfolio/

I\'m sure this is a reference you know Wilma, but your work really made me think about Julietta Singh\'s beautiful book No archive will restore you which departs from Gramci\'s prompt that we must compile an inventory of historical traces in our bodies.


Can\'t find working link but reminds me of Sabine Groenewegen\'s ongoing research in epigenetic trauma and missing people of colour in film (she had a similar experience of hidden family history). https://www.eyefilm.nl/en/whats-on/biak-stories-missing-scenes---een-nieuw-narratief-voor-koloniale-film/646226


Jo Clement - Outlandish 2022 “Jo Clement's first collection confronts Romantic impressions of British Gypsy ethnicity and lyrically lays them to rest. From Wordsworth to Top Gear, her poems invite us to consider notions of otherness, trespass and craft. “

Is there something about the pauses, slips, etc as ways for these voices that have been put in the archive and reused to have some agency through refusal. Also something about through digitisation, transfer, editing and data degradation as being somehow an interesting process that also allows refusal.

you may have read it but ‘Irish Travellers : racism and the politics of culture' was really helpful for me in terms of exploring that heritage as well as addressing the issues of those communities being skeptical about intervention from the state or researcher

The Color of Love - Peggy Ahwesh

And related to what Brontë is saying, the role of ‘critical fabulation\'  - which came up yesterday in Mathew\'s session

https://earlycinema.gla.ac.uk/topic/fairgrounds/ - maybe an interesting way of thinking through working with this material through the lens of a moving image practice - thinking about your comment re traveler communities and being permissible/tolerated within wider communities in terms of providing ‘entertainment\'. 

Probably no time for this one but I wanted to ask you about the relationship the work has to functionality - as in the intention to present and uncover an archive but particularly with your interest in the broken and missing parts. Thinking about context in relation to this, and where you feel the work should be presented in order to fulfil its function or dysfunction/ resistance/ refusal - or how relevant this question is to the work?

Xiyao (14:42)
might be interesting to you - quite ironically, wild life at waste water treatment centre, Britain\'s most endangered birds has been pictured at Europe\'s largest sewage treatment sites in East London:

the irony of waste nurturing endangered lives…

Bryony Gillard she/her (14:45)
To add to Xiyao\'s point - also in terms of WWS as important spaces for insects (tying into yesterday) and the insects are the thing that attracts wild birds….

Also Jackie Wangs book Carceral Capitalism has a very interesting part about how selling blood was offered as a suggestion to resolve debt by a high court judge

Mathew Parkin (14:51)

Bryony Gillard she/her (14:52)

Not directly related to the content of the work per-say but your attentive to the gestures of a particular type of masculinity -  made me think of Mira Mattar\'s Yes I Am A Destroyer…“a man in his spacious body…the ostentatious breathers are distracting, relaxing arrogantly”

Playtime by Jacques Tati (1967) as an aesthetic reference, humourously mocking modern rationalism and sterile banking capitalism. Also interesting in terms of “overperforming”. (Movie)  (Essay on movie)

Something you were saying about microplastics being oil - which is itself compressed biomass. Reminded of this ‘and yet a trace of the true self exists in the false self\' meme
We\'ve talked quite a lot about plastics as synthetic or somehow alien/opposed to the biological so maybe it\'s worth considering to some degree

Collective:  T3RRAPATHY

Dialectics of materials 

From a sociological point of view, it might be interesting to subdivide by habitus or milieu rather than by class, as this could be too dichotomous.


Philipp Dollinger (15:35)
Our Questions:

Philipp Dollinger (15:35)
Contradictory aspects of materials (dialectics of materials)
Historical cases of contamination that can be used as base for poetic narrative?
Which alternative socio-political structures based on the access to specific materials can be imagined as plausible in the future?

Lucy Beech (15:50)
I like the fact that the video component was not VR

Sophie Cundale (15:52)
Some Science Fiction references which come to mind:
Bloodchild - Octavia Butler -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodchild_and_Other_Stories
Cafe Flesh - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Café_Flesh  (1982 punk/pornographic science fiction about 99% population becoming allergic to sex)  
Soylent Green - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green (70s sci-fi set in 2022…. population being fed 'soylent green' as alternative to actual food - but the content of soylent green is dead human, reminds me of Mckenzie Wark's description of Marxs\' Pink Goo)
Born in Flames - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_Flames  (documentary style / feminist fiction - feels relevant aesthetically somehow)
Sounds like new Cronenburg Crimes of the Future could be interesting too.

Jenna Sutela (15:54)
Also obviously think of the classic sci-fi trope, T-1000 in Terminator

Sophie Cundale (15:55)
The Futurological Congress by Stanislaw Lem is interesting in relation to future drug taking

Gabriel Coleman (15:56)
Thinking as well as the similar dynamics going on in the new Cronenberg film (Crimes of the Flesh)

Kirsty Hendry (15:56)

‘Seibo, There Below' is a great collection of short stories by Laszlo Krasznahorkai intended to speak through the perspective of cities and places

Bronte Dow (16:14)
A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1864)  by Jules Verne
^ very intricate tangential 19th century story but there is a chapter dealing with the “voice” of the earth\'s core

Sophie Cundale (16:16)
Jic we run out of time - the question of how to build the fiction is such a tricky one and im dealing with it in my work too so ideas include... writing as a short story, gathering images, graphic novel versions. Maybe writing the POV from the heavy metal itself, from the characters who use the metals. Essentially expanding the world so you know it really well. Also what Bronte was asking - the 'how' of metal ingestion - could be storyboarded or choreographed even.

Lead poisoning from water pipes/infrastructure was a theory for the decline of the roman empire although not, I think, broadly substantiated by historians now

‘Seibo, There Below' is a great collection of short stories by Laszlo Krasznahorkai intended to speak through the perspective of cities and places

Kraznahorkai\'s writing is descriptively exhaustive whereas in Béla Tarr\'s adaptations in film these long passages of detailed description take the form of extremely slow shots where time begins to slow and the smallest change or event takes on monumental proportions for the viewer

Relating to what Riar is saying, it's maybe worth looking into people who have decided to stay/return to the land around fukushima - primarily older people for whom the radiation's effects are less acute in their slower metabolisms

Working With Waste : Meeting 2
Day 3: 22.09.2022
Participant presentation 

David Leal 

I think there is something about waste as a signpost for activity, like both in the way of ‘oh this is the cruising space we can do this here\', but also like there has been life here as we have found traces of waste ( I mean perhaps archaeologically or forensically) . I also woukd really like to see the gaviscone guys go to that cruising site.

Ari Nielsson (17:58)
There are some interesting things about the use of landscaping to suppress cruising in parks in Houlbrook's Queer London - and I know this sort of removal of seclusion has also been true of Hasenheide and almost certainly in many large cities

Mathew Parkin (17:59)

Ari Nielsson (18:01)
Thinking in relation to Bronte\'s comment littering in posh areas also about the absence of bins in (some?) train stations of the uk due to bomb anxieties, where you're just supposed to drop it on the ground and leave it for the cleaners

Bryony Gillard she/her (18:06)
I\'m also interested to know whether you consider the ‘traces\' in the environment you have filmed as waste at all? Is there almost a reverence to the documentation of them? A possible material kinship? Maybe this book could be interesting in relation to this idea https://www.onomatopee.net/exhibition/the-material-kinship-reader/

we are Green Education in Media Camp, thanks for inspiring screening

ari (12:40)
Thanks, first of all, for showing and talking about this beautiful work. You\'ve spoken a bit about seeking out colonial ephemera from hobbyists and the process of finding it and obtaining permission. At the same time there\'s this surreptitious footage from the mining sites and the use of the advertising film. Could you expand on this - I guess my curiosity is less about ‘ethics\' than about legality / ‘getting away with it\'

Xiyao (12:49)
Thanks for showing these expansive works! I'm very interested in your idea about 'unwanted images' - could you expand on this a little bit? Especially in the context of machine learning/AI in your latest film, what's the role of agency in determining images as 'unwanted', i.e. unwanted for machine consumption or human?

Lucy Beech (12:53)
The Myth of the Lazy Native: A Study of the Image of the Malays, Filipinos and Javanese from the 16th to the 20th Century and Its Function in the Ideology of Colonial Capitalism. By Syed Hussein Alatas. Frank Cass & Co.London, 1977.
ari (12:54)

Relating to this question of energy, and what you said about the consumption of images being the consumption of minerals, I was wondering how you consider the position of AI in this process. I noticed it was marked as ‘sun powered\', and was also reminded of stephanie comilang and simon speiser\'s recent technofeminist AI-centric work piña

Bronte (12:58)
wanted to ask about Dr Munarwan's proposition of geoengineering as indigenous practice that has been going on for a long time (he worded it differently).  Feels like this blows open contemporary conceptions of geoengineering. could you expand or this, or elaborate on what he meant?
Sophie Hoyle (13:07)

Working With Waste : Meeting 2 
Day 1 : 19.09.2022

Guest Speaker : Simon Werrett
Event: Lecture: Thrifty Science
Monday 19th September 10:30-11:50


Andra Nadirshah (11:34)
Transubstantiation practices now and then? What is the throughline of the knowledge-power of the making of the body from the object via ceremony? And how does this Christian institution situate now with our heightened objectification? How does that situate into modern pharmaceuticals which erase the difference the human body and an “object” such as pill which integrates into the body?

David Leal (11:53)
I think it's very interesting the relation between Christianity and Thiftyness. I wonder if that was a preached principle also so that the church could be closer to the position of the king - the one that spends/has it all. But also how that word still relates to charity and missionary, I believe.

Event: Artist talk and screening 


James Richards
how do you see creating alternative temporalities as one way of disrupting or intervening in the modern bounded art making subject/eye
and where does the gut come into this?			
I think the combination of Gretchen Bender and Leslie Thornton videos reminded me of Rob Halpern\'s poetry Touching Voids in Sense about caring for his dying lover and wounds and death in general
It feels like a sense of unrequited love/longing/desire is being spoken through these used/discarded objects. That the bodily images - being used out of place (i.e. not in a medical context) are also displaced and wandering in search of something - unhinged maybe. And the processing of these images themselves also contributes to this sense of sentience or aliveness in the image and objects that is besides from their function, that can then speaks to the viewer in a weirdly familiar - in the uncanny sense of the word - language. 

The processing of the images make them feel unfamiliar too - beyond augmented - use the processing for the mood- generating new moods - processing so it goes beyond and image into abstraction.
